Hexanacci Sequence

Imagine you are playing a board game. You roll a 6-faced dice and move forward
the same number of spaces that you rolled. If the finishing point is "n" spaces
away from the starting point, please implement a program that calculates how many
possible ways are there to arrive exactly at the finishing point?

Example:
If n=9, how many possible ways are there to arrive exactly at the finishing point?
248
