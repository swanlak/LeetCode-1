One Edit Distance

Given two string S and T, determine if they are both one edit distance apart.

Example:
S="abcd", T="abc" => true

In the implementation, you should consider the following four situations:

    Situation1   Situation2   Situation3   Situation4
S:    "abc"        "abc"        "abbde"      "adc"
T:    "abc"        "abcd"       "abcde"      "abdc"
