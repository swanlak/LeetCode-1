Find Arithmetic Slices: (Codility)

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements
and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. For example, these are arithmetic sequences:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9

The sequence [1, 1, 2, 5, 7] is not arithmetic.

A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given.
A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.

A slice (P,Q) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:

	A[P], A[P+1], ..., A[Q-1], A[Q]

is arithmetic, In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.

Write a function:

	class Solution { public int solution(int[] A);}

that, given array A consisting of N numbers, returns the number of arithmetic slices in A.

For example, given array A such that:

	A[0] = -1
	A[1] =  1
	A[2] =  3
	A[3] =  3
	A[4] =  3
	A[5] =  2
	A[6] =  1
	A[7] =  0

the function should return 5 because there are five arithmetic slices of that array, namely:

	(0, 2) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7)

Assume that:
	* N is an integer within the range [0..100];
	* each element of array A is an integer within the range [-1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
