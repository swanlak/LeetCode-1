Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that
they add up to specific target. You may assume that each input would have
exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Note: The input array is already sorted in ascending order.

Example:

Given
nums = [2, 7, 4, 3], target = 9
Sunce num[0] + num[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1]
