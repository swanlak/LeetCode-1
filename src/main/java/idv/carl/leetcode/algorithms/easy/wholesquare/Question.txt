Whole Square: (Codility)

An integer P is a whole square if it is a square of some integer Q; i.e. if P = Q^2.

Write a function:

	class Solution { public int solution(int A, int B); }

that, given two integers A and B, returns the number of whole squares within the interval [A..B] (both ends included).

For example, given A = 4 and B = 17, the function should return 3,
because there are three squares of integers in the interval [4..17], namely 4 = 2^2, 9 = 3^2 and 16 = 4^2.

Assume that:

	* A and B are integers within the range [-2,147,483,648...2,147,483,647];
	* A <= B.

Complexity:

	* expected worst-case time complexity is O(sqrt(abs(B)));
	* expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
