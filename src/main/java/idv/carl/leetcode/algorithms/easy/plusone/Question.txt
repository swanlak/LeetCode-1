Plus One:

Given a number which might be non-negative/negative and present it in the form of int array, for example:

* non-negative number: 9487 -> [9, 4, 8, 7]
* negative number: -400 -> [-4, 0, 0]

Please implement a method which will increment the number by 1 each time and keep the content of the array is correct, such as:

9487 plus one: [9, 4, 8, 8]
-400 plus one: [-3, 9, 9]

Please consider some edge cases.
