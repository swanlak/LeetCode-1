List recipient: (Codility)

Given a table transfers with the following structure:

 create table transfers (
 	sender varchar not null,
 	recipient varchar not null,
 	date date not null,
 	amount integer not null
 );

Write a query in SQL that returns a list of accounts that have received at least 1024 USD in at most three transfers.
In other words, an account name is to be listed if there exist some three (or fewer) transfers,
with the recipient equal to the account name, such that the sum of the transferred amounts is not less that 1024 USD.
Note that there can be more than three transfers to that account,
as long as some three or fewer transfers amount to at least 1024 USD.
The table should be ordered by name (in ascending order).

The sender and recipient columns contain the names of the corresponding accounts, the date column contains
the dates of the transfers, and the amount column contains the transferred amounts expressed in USD.
You can assume that the sender Value is different from the recipient value in each row.

For example, given the following data:

	 sender	  | recipient | date 	   | amount
	----------+-----------+------------+----------
	 Smith	  | Williams  | 2000-01-01 | 200
	 Smith    | Taylor	  | 2002-09-27 | 1024
	 Smith	  | Johnson	  | 2005-06-26 | 512
	 Williams | Johnson	  | 2010-12-17 | 100
	 Williams | Johnson	  | 2004-03-22 | 10
	 Brown	  | Johnson	  | 2013-03-20 | 500
	 Johnson  | Williams  | 2007-06-02 | 400
	 Johnson  | Williams  | 2005-06-26 | 400
	 Johnson  | Williams  | 2005-06-26 | 200

your query should return the following rowset:

	account_name
	------------
	Johnson
	Taylor

The Johnson account is listed because it has received 1112 USD in the following three transfers:
512 USD + 100 USD + 500 USD = 1112 USD. The Taylor account has received 1024 USD in just one transfer.
The Williams account received 1200 USD in four transfers,
but it is not listed because no three transfers to that account total at least 1024 USD.

The name of the column in the rowset doesn't matter.
